# - Calls a lambda to trigger a deploy on the server this lambda should start up a new container
# - You can search old instance by a tag so its easy to identify and you dont have to set up ip on an environment variable like a did on this case
# - (you can create and use a new instance if you are worried about space,
# - test if the service got working and drain connections on load balance from old instance to new and after that delete de old instance / container)
# - Since im using a free aws account and to simplify this exercise I will go for something simple with ssh to the instance and an small downtime on deploy.

# Beside this we could also use dockerhub for a better implementation instead of using s3 upload and github tag versioning (and if we go that way we should go all in into kubernetes but that requires like a lot of work)

#I will commit start-up.sh in the project too so its easier to check it out but its fairly simple.
